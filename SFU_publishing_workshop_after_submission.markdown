    hints for what to do after submission - responding to reviewers etc
-->

# I've submitted a paper. What happens now?
Hurry up and wait. 

How long you should expect to wait depends on the journal

Basic steps - BES figure 

You can expect to hear back pretty quickly if it doesn't go out to review, and to wait a while if it does.

Is it okay to bug the editor?
    Sometimes
    Ask your advisor/senior author

## Rejected?
trickle-down journal?
    Positive: Can be a very convenient and time-effective way to fast-track publication
    Negative: you may want to have the paper somewhere higher-profile

decide on an alternative venue
    Implement any changes as you might get the same reviewers at the new journal and you don't want to piss them off!


## Not rejected
- Accepted with minor revisions
- Accepted with major revisions
- Invitation to revise and resubmit
May still be rejected after re-submission so this can be a good time to submit elsewhere if you feel it might be better received at another journal

###responding to reviews
Overall goal is to convey the message: We appreciate and acknowledge your criticism and advice; we understand your misunderstanding; we have fully integrated your feedback"

Do: Be polite, conciliator and thorough.
Don't: 
    Tell the editor/reviewer that they don't know what they're talking about
    Totally ignore comments if you don't want to change something


Your response will have two parts - to the editor, and to the reviewers

You can make comments to the editor that the reviewers won't see.
If you think the reviewers are were totally out to lunch, you can even make the decision to write to the editor rebutting the reviews rather than addressing the suggestions - but you need to be really sure of yourself to do this.

Be clever about your wording if there are things you don't want to change


Don't be surprised if the response ends up taking a LONG time to write, and is a big document! But, save yourself, the editor and the reviewers time by using short one-word responses like "Agreed." or "Amended." where appropriate.

Make your response as easy to navigate as possible
    Quote each comment/suggestion
    Carefully section, or consider using a table format
    Order the responses according to their importance or split into major and minor
