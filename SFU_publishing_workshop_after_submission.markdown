    hints for what to do after submission - responding to reviewers etc
-->

# I've submitted a paper. What happens now?
Hurry up and wait. How long you'll have to wait largely depends on the journal. Different journals have different stops in the editorial/review process, and some are just inherently slower than others. The basic process is summarised in the flow chart below, which comes from the British Ecological Society's guide to peer review (worth reading, especially if you're about to review a manuscript for the first time --- I've provided the link in the resources section). In addition to what's shown in this figure, some especially high-impact journals (Nature and Science... perhaps others) also have "Gatekeeper" reviewers ---  who articles get sent to for a quick "worth reviewing" vs. "reject without review" before they actually go out for formal review.

![publication steps](BES_publishing_flowchart.pdf)

What this boils down to is that, depending on the journal, you should expect to hear back within a few hours to a couple of weeks depending on whether your article has been sent out for review. There are horror stories of people not hearing anything for 6 months, only to be told that their MS wasn't even sent out for review, but this definitely qualifies as a time when it's okay to bug the editor (see below), and most of the time you should hear back pretty quickly.

Once your paper has been sent out for review, the fastest-turnaround journals can have reviews back to you within a month. At the slowest journals its not uncommon to wait several months. 

Turn-around speed is actually something to weigh up pretty carefully when submitting papers. Sometimes you might face a trade-off of publishing somewhere high profile that might have a very slow turn-around, vs. somewhere a bit lower profile with a faster turn-around. Getting papers out sooner can be important if you're applying for jobs/scholarships etc., so its something to consider. Your supervisors, peers, and other colleagues are generally the best resource for getting a handle for the turn-around speed of a given journal. Journal websites often tell you expected turn-around speed (though the estimates tend to be overly optimistic).

SA: maybe mention that you can check the submission to acceptance dates on some recent papers in the journals (although maybe this is getting more into the "before" stuff)

## When is it okay to bug the editor
Sometimes. Its never a good idea to piss off the editor, but if you've been waiting considerably longer than the estimated times provided by the journal *politely* checking in about the status of your paper is okay. Your advisor/senior collaborators are good people to ask if you're unsure, and might even be willing to get in touch with the editor on your behalf.

## Rejected?
XX% of papers get rejected, so don't be disheartened. It's not necessarily a reflection on the quality of your work. A surprising number of seminal papers were rejected on their first submission. For example, the paper that came up with the concept of trophic levels got rejected when it was first submitted [@Lindeman:1942]. You'll probably end up with a better, more widely-read paper once you've taken the reviewers' concerns on board.

An increasing number of Journals now have "trickle-down" (or "dumping ground", depending on your level of cynicism) sister journals. A couple of examples are Ecosphere for Ecology, Ecosystems for Ecology letters, and Nature has several topic-specific sub-journals like Nature Climate Change, and there are many others. If the editor thinks your paper is good but not quite sexy enough for the flagship journal, the rejection may come with an invitation to "transfer your submission" or "automatically resubmit" to the sister journal. 

If you get the option, transferring your submission to such a "trickle-down" journal can be a very convenient and time-effective way to fast-track publication. Often your reviews carry over. 
The disadvantage is that you may want to get the paper somewhere higher-profile than the trickle-down option. In that case, you have to figure out the trade-off of potential benefits vs. the time cost and risk of another rejection if you do resubmit. 

If you do decide to resubmit elsewhere, *implement suggested changes you got from the first review*. You could well get the same reviewers at the new journal and you don't want to piss them off! And you'll probably end up with a better paper --- that's the point of peer review.

## Not rejected
- Accepted with minor revisions
- Accepted with major revisions
- Invitation to revise and resubmit
May still be rejected after re-submission so this can be a good time to submit elsewhere if you feel it might be better received at another journal
<!--SA: should be rare, but some think this is becoming more frequent... the cynical view is that this can be done to keep acceptance times lower-->

### Responding to reviews
Overall goal is to convey the message: We appreciate and acknowledge your criticism and advice; we understand your misunderstanding; we have fully integrated your feedback"

Do: Be polite, conciliator and thorough.
Don't: 
    Tell the editor/reviewer that they don't know what they're talking about
    Totally ignore comments if you don't want to change something


Your response will have two parts: to the editor, and to the reviewers

You can make comments to the editor that the reviewers won't see.
If you think the reviewers are were totally out to lunch, you can even make the decision to write to the editor rebutting the reviews rather than addressing the suggestions --- but you need to be really sure of yourself to do this.

<!--SA: something about pick your battles wisely, chances of success are low-->

Be clever about your wording if there are things you don't want to change

Don't be surprised if the response ends up taking a LONG time to write, and is a big document! But, save yourself, the editor and the reviewers time by using short one-word responses like "Agreed." or "Amended." where appropriate.

Make your response as easy to navigate as possible
    Quote each comment/suggestion
    Carefully section, or consider using a table format
    Order the responses according to their importance or split into major and minor

SA: some other things:
- make the editor's job as easy as possible
- include *everything* in your response... you don't want to (or give the impression) that you are skipping anything
- start by copying and pasting all the reviewer responses and then interleave your responses
- if the reviewers didn't criticize it, think *very* carefully before touching it; that's part an "if it ain't broke don't touch it" and also you don't want to create new content that the editor feels needs to be peer reviewed
- if you edited the paper in any way besides in response to the reviewers, note it to the editor
- many journals will request a tracked-changes version, some that don't will still appreciate it, some will specifically say not to
- if the response document is long, start by summarizing the most important aspects for the editor
- keep in mind that the reviewers (and/or a new reviewer) may read what you right... regardless, write assuming they will read it
- pick your battles wisely... you can sometimes push back on a limited number of reviewer requests, but for the most part you need to just do it. If you're indifferent one way or other, just do it so you can push back where you feel it is important.

- remember that the reviewers volunteered to offer you comments to improve your work --- always take the tone of thankfullness in your response. Make sure to get across that you're thankful for the reviewer's suggestions and emphasize how the changes have improved the manuscript.
